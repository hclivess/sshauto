Automate SSH connections, send bulk commands to multiple servers without having to log in to them individually.

Create `secret.json` from `secret_demo.json` and adjust settings.

Currently, servers need to have the same password (will be extended with a more individualized json config).

All commands you want to execute go to `command.txt`, which is also shared by all servers.
